I want bug-free, highly optimized code that follows best practices and is easy to maintain and develop. Everything in the bot should be configurable, including embed colors, the bot name, prefixes, and values, JUST EVERYTHING. The code should look like it was made by a human, not an AI. Everything should work. And the bot should have centralized error system, etc. So there wont be long ass files. And also remember that all commands use slash only, and developer commands use only prefix! AND NO LONG ASS CODES. I DONT WANT A MESS
