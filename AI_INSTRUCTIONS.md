Build a Discord bot with clean, modular, production-grade code. No spaghetti logic. All functionality must be strictly organized by responsibility: commands, events, config, utilities, and error handling in separate files. All user-facing commands must use slash only. Developer-only commands use prefix only. Every aspect of the bot must be configurable through a central config file: bot name, embed colors, prefix, feature toggles, etc. Code must follow modern best practices, be fully optimized, and easy to maintain. No redundant code. No bloated logic. Implement centralized error handling. Zero tolerance for bugs or regressions. Code must look human-written and clean, not AI-generated. Compact, clear, and powerful â€” no long files, no convoluted nesting, no excessive abstraction. Output only final, functional code.
