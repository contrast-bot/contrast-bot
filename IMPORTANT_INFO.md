# Contrast Discord Bot - Updated Documentation

## Project Overview

Contrast is a highly configurable, feature-rich Discord bot built with TypeScript and Discord.js. It provides comprehensive functionality including utility commands, economy system, reputation tracking, leveling, gambling games, and work system with **UNLIMITED TRANSACTION SUPPORT** and **PUBLIC GAMBLING RESULTS** for maximum community engagement.

### Key Features

- **Command System**: Supports slash commands for regular users and prefix commands exclusively for developers
- **Economy System**: Virtual currency with **UNLIMITED TRANSACTIONS**, daily/weekly/monthly/yearly rewards with streak multipliers, gambling games, work system, and comprehensive transaction tracking
- **Safe System**: Secure storage that protects coins from all-in gambling losses, with upgradeable capacity
- **Shop System**: Purchase upgrades and items including safe expansions, XP boosts, and transfer limit upgrades
- **Reputation System**: Allow users to give and receive reputation points with XP rewards
- **Level System**: XP-based progression with rewards for various activities including commands, gambling, work, and social interactions
- **Gambling Games**: Multiple games including slots, coinflip, dice roll, number guess, roulette, and Russian Roulette with **BULK PLAY OPTIONS** (up to 50+ repeats) and **PUBLIC RESULTS** for community engagement
- **Work System**: Balanced earning mechanism with cooldowns, salary scaling based on balance, and bonus chances
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to prevent spam (10s for work, 2s for gambling, 10s for rewards, 3/s general)
- **Utility Commands**: Server info, user info, avatar display, and comprehensive help system
- **Fun Features**: Jokes, facts, quotes, and mini-games
- **Developer Tools**: Server management, blacklist control, maintenance mode with webhook alerts, shop item management
- **Webhook Alerts**: Optional Discord webhook notifications for developer actions

### Command Architecture

**STRICT COMMAND TYPE SEPARATION:**

- **Regular User Commands**: ALL regular commands use SLASH COMMANDS ONLY (`/command`)
  - No prefix commands for regular users
  - Modern Discord interface with autocomplete and validation
  - Better user experience and discoverability

- **Developer Commands**: ALL developer commands use PREFIX COMMANDS ONLY (`?command`)
  - No slash commands for developers
  - Quick access for administrative tasks
  - Separate from user-facing commands for security

This separation ensures clear distinction between user and administrative functionality while providing the best interface for each use case.

### Global System Architecture

**ALL DATA IS GLOBAL ACROSS DISCORD SERVERS:**

- **Economy System**: User balances, transaction history, and daily/monthly/yearly streaks are shared across all servers
- **Level System**: XP, levels, and progression are global - users maintain the same level regardless of which server they're in
- **Reputation System**: Reputation points (positive/negative, given/received) are global across all servers
- **Gambling Statistics**: All gambling stats, leaderboards, and records are global
- **Work History**: Work earnings and statistics are global
- **User Data**: All user data (quotes, feedback, etc.) is stored globally by Discord User ID

This design ensures users have a consistent experience across all servers where the bot is present and prevents data fragmentation.

## Critical Design Principles

### üö® GAMBLING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS üö®

**NEVER CHANGE THESE WITHOUT EXPLICIT APPROVAL:**

1. **PUBLIC RESULTS**: All gambling game results MUST be visible to everyone in the channel (not ephemeral). This creates excitement, engagement, and community interaction.

2. **PRIVATE ERROR MESSAGES**: Error messages, rate limits, and insufficient funds warnings should remain ephemeral (private) to avoid spam.

3. **RUSSIAN ROULETTE CONFIRMATION**: The confirmation dialog for Russian Roulette MUST remain private (ephemeral) for user safety, but the final result MUST be public.

4. **UNLIMITED TRANSACTIONS**: The bot supports unlimited transaction amounts for maximum flexibility and fun. Regular betting games have a 1 billion coin limit, but all-in games like Russian Roulette have no limits.

5. **BULK PLAY SUPPORT**: All gambling games support bulk play with high repeat counts (20+ repeats recommended) for faster gameplay and reduced bot slowness.

6. **RATE LIMITING**: Gambling commands are rate-limited to 2 seconds per user to prevent spam while maintaining engagement.

### üõ°Ô∏è Code Safety Guidelines

#### For AI Assistants and Future Development

**CRITICAL - READ BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES:**

1. **Database Schema**: The database schema is carefully designed and tested. Do NOT modify table structures without understanding all dependencies.

2. **Transaction Safety**: All economy operations use database transactions. Never bypass the existing economy manager functions.

3. **Rate Limiting**: The rate limiting system is essential for server stability. Do not remove or significantly modify without testing.

4. **Error Handling**: All gambling functions have specific error handling for edge cases. Maintain this pattern.

5. **XP System Integration**: The level system is integrated with all major bot functions. Changes to one system may affect others.

6. **Command Type Separation**: NEVER mix slash and prefix commands. Regular commands are slash-only, developer commands are prefix-only.

7. **Configurable Limits**: All transaction limits are configurable in the economy manager. The default is set to unlimited for maximum flexibility.

## Configurable Economy Limits

The bot includes highly configurable limits that can be adjusted in `src/utils/economy-manager.ts`:

\`\`\`typescript
export const ECONOMY_LIMITS = {
  MAX_TRANSACTION_AMOUNT: Infinity, // No limit on transactions
  MAX_BET_AMOUNT: 1000000000, // 1 billion for regular bets (not all-in games)
  MAX_TRANSFER_AMOUNT: Infinity, // No limit on transfers
  MAX_WORK_EARNINGS: Infinity, // No limit on work earnings
}
\`\`\`

**Key Points:**
- Set any limit to `Infinity` for unlimited transactions
- `MAX_BET_AMOUNT` only applies to regular gambling games, NOT all-in games like Russian Roulette
- All limits are easily configurable without code changes
- Default configuration prioritizes fun and flexibility over restrictions

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

1. **Bug-Free Code**: All code must be thoroughly tested and free of bugs before submission. Pay special attention to:
   - Large number handling (unlimited transaction support)
   - Database transaction integrity
   - Rate limiting edge cases
   - Public vs private message handling
   - Command type separation (slash vs prefix)
   - Bulk play functionality for gambling games

2. **Optimization**: Code should be well-optimized and structured for easy future development and maintenance.

3. **Logical Design**: All implementations should make sense and not introduce new problems. Consider the user experience and community engagement.

### AI-Generated Code Policy

4. **AI Usage Warning**: If using AI to generate code for PRs:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER** let AI modify gambling result visibility without explicit instruction

   - **MANDATORY**: Test bulk play functionality if gambling games were modified
   - PRs without proper descriptions will be closed

8. **Branch Strategy**:
   - **DO NOT** open PRs directly to the `main` branch
   - All PRs should target the `development` branch
   - Code will be merged to `main` only after thorough testing and verification

## Setup and Configuration

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the required variables
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Initialize the database with `npm run init-db`
5. Build the project with `npm run build`
6. Deploy commands with `npm run deploy` (deploys slash commands only)
7. Start the bot with `npm start`

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured in your `.env` file:

- `TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token (REQUIRED)
- `CLIENT_ID`: Your bot's application ID (REQUIRED)
- `GUILD_ID`: Your development server ID
- `PREFIX`: Command prefix for developer commands (default: `?`)
- `BOT_NAME`: Custom name for your bot (default: `Contrast`)

- **Gambling Commands**: 1 request per 2 seconds (prevents spam while maintaining engagement)
- **Reward Commands** (daily/monthly/yearly): 1 request per 10 seconds
- **General Commands**: 3 requests per second

Rate limits are applied per user and automatically clean up old entries.

## Database Schema Notes

### Critical Tables
- `user_economy`: Core economy data with balance, streaks, and totals
- `transactions`: All financial transactions with full audit trail
- `gambling_stats`: Gambling statistics and leaderboards
- `user_levels`: XP and level progression data
- `reputation`: User reputation system

### Important Constraints
- All economy operations use transactions for data integrity
- Foreign key relationships maintain data consistency
- Timestamps are stored as Unix milliseconds for precision
- No artificial limits on transaction amounts (configurable)

### Global Data Design
- All user tables use Discord User ID as the primary key (NOT Guild ID)
- No server-specific user data storage
- Users maintain consistent data across all servers
- Leaderboards and statistics are global across the entire bot network

## Testing Guidelines

### Before Any Release

1. **Gambling Games**: Test all gambling games with various bet amounts and bulk play:
   - Small bets (1-10 coins)
   - Medium bets (1,000-10,000 coins)
   - Large bets (100,000+ coins)
   - Maximum balance scenarios (billions+ coins)
   - Bulk play with high repeat counts (20+ repeats)

2. **Work System**: Test work command with different balance levels:
   - New users with 0 balance
   - Users with medium balances (10,000-100,000 coins)
   - Users with high balances (1M+ coins)
   - Bonus chance functionality

3. **Public/Private Behavior**: Verify that:
   - Gambling results are visible to everyone
   - Work results are visible to everyone
   - Error messages are private
   - Rate limit messages are private
   - Russian Roulette confirmation is private, result is public

4. **Rate Limiting**: Test rate limits don't break normal usage patterns

5. **Database Integrity**: Ensure all transactions are properly recorded

6. **Global Data Consistency**: Verify that:
   - User data persists across different servers
   - Leaderboards show global statistics
   - No server-specific data isolation occurs
   - User balances/levels are the same in all servers

7. **Command Type Verification**: Ensure that:
   - All regular commands work as slash commands
   - All developer commands work as prefix commands
   - No command has both implementations
   - Command deployment only registers slash commands

8. **Unlimited Transaction Support**: Test that:
   - Large transactions (billions+ coins) work correctly
   - No artificial limits prevent legitimate transactions
   - All-in games like Russian Roulette handle any balance size
   - Regular games respect the 1 billion limit but can be configured
