- **Gambling Games**: Multiple games including slots, coinflip, dice roll, number guess, and Russian Roulette with bulk play options and **PUBLIC RESULTS** for community engagement
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to prevent spam and reduce server load (2s for gambling, 10s for rewards, 3/s general)
- **Utility Commands**: Server info, user info, avatar display, and more
- **Fun Features**: Jokes, facts, quotes, and mini-games
- **Developer Tools**: Server management, blacklist control, maintenance mode with webhook alerts
- **Webhook Alerts**: Optional Discord webhook notifications for developer actions

## Critical Design Principles

### üö® GAMBLING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS üö®

**NEVER CHANGE THESE WITHOUT EXPLICIT APPROVAL:**

1. **PUBLIC RESULTS**: All gambling game results MUST be visible to everyone in the channel (not ephemeral). This creates excitement, engagement, and community interaction.

2. **PRIVATE ERROR MESSAGES**: Error messages, rate limits, and insufficient funds warnings should remain ephemeral (private) to avoid spam.

3. **RUSSIAN ROULETTE CONFIRMATION**: The confirmation dialog for Russian Roulette MUST remain private (ephemeral) for user safety, but the final result MUST be public.

4. **BALANCE SAFETY**: Russian Roulette has been specifically fixed for large balance handling (10M+ coins). Do not modify the balance verification logic without thorough testing.

5. **RATE LIMITING**: Gambling commands are rate-limited to 2 seconds per user to prevent spam while maintaining engagement.

### üõ°Ô∏è Code Safety Guidelines

#### For AI Assistants and Future Development

**CRITICAL - READ BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES:**

1. **Database Schema**: The database schema is carefully designed and tested. Do NOT modify table structures without understanding all dependencies.

2. **Transaction Safety**: All economy operations use database transactions. Never bypass the existing economy manager functions.

3. **Rate Limiting**: The rate limiting system is essential for server stability. Do not remove or significantly modify without testing.

4. **Error Handling**: All gambling functions have specific error handling for edge cases. Maintain this pattern.

5. **XP System Integration**: The level system is integrated with all major bot functions. Changes to one system may affect others.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code directory
  - `commands/`: Command implementations organized by category
    - `Games/`: Gambling and fun games (PUBLIC RESULTS)
    - `Economy/`: Currency management and rewards
    - `Social/`: Reputation and level systems
    - `Utility/`: General bot utilities
    - `Developer/`: Admin-only prefix commands
  - `events/`: Discord.js event handlers
  - `utils/`: Core utility functions and managers
  - `constants/`: Static data like jokes and facts
  - `index.ts`: Main entry point

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

1. **Bug-Free Code**: All code must be thoroughly tested and free of bugs before submission. Pay special attention to:
   - Large number handling (Russian Roulette bug was caused by improper balance verification)
   - Database transaction integrity
   - Rate limiting edge cases
   - Public vs private message handling

2. **Optimization**: Code should be well-optimized and structured for easy future development and maintenance.

3. **Logical Design**: All implementations should make sense and not introduce new problems. Consider the user experience and community engagement.

### AI-Generated Code Policy

4. **AI Usage Warning**: If using AI to generate code for PRs:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER** let AI modify gambling result visibility without explicit instruction
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER** let AI change database transaction logic
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER** let AI modify rate limiting without understanding the impact
   - Ensure everything works correctly and maintains existing behavior
   - Refine AI-generated code to maintain natural, human-written style and quality
   - Test all gambling games thoroughly, especially with large balances
   - Verify that public/private message behavior is preserved

### Customization and Flexibility

5. **Configurability**: The bot should remain highly customizable through environment variables. The bot name can be set in `.env` and will be reflected in all outputs (embeds, messages, etc.).

### Contribution Process

6. **Commit Standards**:
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Include detailed descriptions of changes in commit bodies
   - Mention if gambling visibility or core systems were modified
   
7. **Pull Request Requirements**:
   - Clearly specify all changes made in your PR description
   - **MANDATORY**: State whether gambling results remain public
   - **MANDATORY**: Confirm rate limiting behavior is preserved
   - PRs without proper descriptions will be closed

8. **Branch Strategy**:
   - **DO NOT** open PRs directly to the `main` branch
   - All PRs should target the `development` branch
   - Code will be merged to `main` only after thorough testing and verification

## Setup and Configuration

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the required variables
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Initialize the database with `npm run init-db`
5. Build the project with `npm run build`
6. Deploy commands with `npm run deploy`
7. Start the bot with `npm start`

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured in your `.env` file:

- `TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token (REQUIRED)
- `CLIENT_ID`: Your bot's application ID (REQUIRED)
- `GUILD_ID`: Your development server ID
- `PREFIX`: Command prefix for developer commands (default: `?`)
- `BOT_NAME`: Custom name for your bot (default: `Contrast`)
- `STATUS`: Bot's status (online, idle, dnd, invisible)
- `ACTIVITY_TYPE`: Activity type (PLAYING, WATCHING, LISTENING, COMPETING, STREAMING)
- `ACTIVITY_NAME`: Activity name displayed in the bot's status
- `DEPLOY_GUILD_COMMANDS`: Set to "true" to deploy commands to a specific guild only
- `DEVELOPER_WEBHOOK_URL`: Discord webhook URL for developer alerts (optional)
- `DONATE_URL`: Donation URL for the donate command

## Rate Limiting Configuration

The bot includes built-in rate limiting to prevent spam and maintain server stability:

- **Gambling Commands**: 1 request per 2 seconds (prevents spam while maintaining engagement)
- **Reward Commands** (daily/monthly/yearly): 1 request per 10 seconds
- **General Commands**: 3 requests per second

Rate limits are applied per user and automatically clean up old entries.

## Database Schema Notes

### Critical Tables
- `user_economy`: Core economy data with balance, streaks, and totals
- `transactions`: All financial transactions with full audit trail
- `gambling_stats`: Gambling statistics and leaderboards
- `user_levels`: XP and level progression data
- `reputation`: User reputation system

### Important Constraints
- All economy operations use transactions for data integrity
- Foreign key relationships maintain data consistency
- Timestamps are stored as Unix milliseconds for precision

## Testing Guidelines

### Before Any Release

1. **Gambling Games**: Test all gambling games with various bet amounts, including edge cases:
   - Small bets (1-10 coins)
   - Medium bets (1,000-10,000 coins)
   - Large bets (100,000+ coins)
   - Maximum balance scenarios (10M+ coins)

2. **Public/Private Behavior**: Verify that:
   - Gambling results are visible to everyone
   - Error messages are private
   - Rate limit messages are private
   - Russian Roulette confirmation is private, result is public

3. **Rate Limiting**: Test rate limits don't break normal usage patterns

4. **Database Integrity**: Ensure all transactions are properly recorded

## For AI Assistants

If you're an AI assistant helping with this project:
