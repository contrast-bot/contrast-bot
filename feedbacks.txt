You should improve definitely the russian roulette since it is the best game, then improve the ping and lags as well, put up on hosting, limit 1 message request to 2s for example or so

@Blake
I would add /slots. coinflip and dice roll is too boring. Rate-limit would be nice and some 24/7 server hosting. /monthly and /yearly would be nice too. But otherwise cool, works as it should.
- The `/slots` - fruit spin, 3 random fruits + jackpot, dank memer had this in the past. I guess it was by percentage chance and not completely random,
- `/monthly` - every month the user gets 500 coins
- `/yearly` - both monthly but 1000 coins

@maty7253.
It would be good if we delete all moderation commands, and then some Utility commands (for example /remind is completely useless). It would also be good if we finally fix bot names in footers since the project is supposed to be fully customizable and open-source. Also, all games should have the option to bet coins, because gambling is literally the only thing that keeps the bot alive. Possibly add a few more games and those commands @Blake was talking about (thanks a lot for the ideas @blake)

@zwaldo2
Too few gambling possibilities

@unknown
Remove number-guess, since it's using a lot of bot's resources and absolutely destroying everything with rate limits. But if you really want to keep the command, you can change it to `/number-guess <number> <total numbers> <bet>` (where <number> is the number you are guessing, <total numbers> are all numbers (for example if total numbers equals to 4, it will be a range from 1 to 4 - 4 possible numbers))
