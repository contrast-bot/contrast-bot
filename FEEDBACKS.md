> Max transaction amount between users should be 1b

@maty7253:
> The maximum amount for all transactions, bets, etc., should be 1 billion. This does not apply to all-in games, such as Russian Roulette.
> However, these numbers should be highly customizable, as mentioned in IMPORTANT_INFO.md. They can be customized to an infinite number.
> I recommend you to set limit of every transaction, bet, etc to infinite. This way the bot can be more funny
> Also update IMPORTANT_INFO.md since it's outdated and AI assistants are making the bot even worse...
