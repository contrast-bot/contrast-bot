> If there is an error when the user doesn't have enough money, display `/work` as a tip instead of `/daily claim`.
> Remove the "`/yearly claim/status`" and replace it with the `/weekly claim/status`. I highly doubt someone will use the bot every year. But if you want to keep the `/yearly claim/status` command, go for it... I don't care as long `/weekly claim/status` command exists :D
