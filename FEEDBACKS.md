> Max transaction amount between users should be 1b

@maty7253:
> The maximum amount for all transactions, bets, etc., should be 1 billion. This does not apply to all-in games, such as Russian Roulette.
> However, these numbers should be highly customizable, as mentioned in IMPORTANT_INFO.md. They can be customized to an infinite number.
> I recommend you to set limit of every transaction, bet, etc to infinite. This way the bot can be more funny
> Also update IMPORTANT_INFO.md since it's outdated and AI assistants are making the bot even worse...

@unknown5
> Add a work command where the user can go to work and earn money. There should be a short cooldown period before working again (10 seconds). The salary depends on the user's current balance to maintain balance. There is also a chance to earn more while working (it's also gambling, but you can't lose anything). I hope you know what I mean.

@verygoodpizzaa
> There should be more repeat steps (for example 20 or more if possible) for all games that support the repeat system, so the bot won't be so slow
