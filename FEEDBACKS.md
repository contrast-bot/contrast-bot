> Add bank commands (`/Bank Deposit/Withdraw/Status`)
> This way, players will only lose their balance when they go all-in in games, not the balance in their banks.
> And add regular roulette to the gambling

@unknown7
> If there is an error when the user doesn't have enough money, display `/work` as a tip instead of `/daily claim`.
> Remove the "`/yearly claim/status`" and replace it with the `/weekly claim/status`. I highly doubt someone will use the bot every year. But if you want to keep the `/yearly claim/status` command, go for it... I don't care as long `/weekly claim/status` command exists :D

@maty7253.
> Add a `/shop` command where other users can purchase items and upgrades with  coins. For example, one of the upgrades could be an infinite coin transfer limit. Another option is an XP boost item that gives you 1,000 XP when purchased. This item has multiple stages, with each stage providing more XP but costing more coins. There could be 10 or 20 stages, but you could only buy stage 20 repeatedly. Alternatively, there could be infinite stages. I don't care

> As @bean_shredding_mexican said about the `/bank` command, there could be an upgrade where you can buy more capacity for the bank. We can call this bank "safe," or it doesn't have to be the `/bank` command; it could be the `/safe` command. I'll leave it entirely up to you. I hope you get the idea. :)
> Example
> - `/shop list` - will list available items in the shop for the user
> - `/shop buy <item> <id>` -> where `<item>` is the item you want to buy (for example XP pack) and `<id>` is the serial number of the upgrade (for example XP pack upgrade stage 2) -> and it should look like this `/shop buy XP Upgrade 2`
>   - Note: it doesnt have to be like I have written. Do it as you like

@kayley.skylover
> Improve the `/blacklist list` command, so it will show everyone who was blacklisted in embed (if possible), and include their username.
> Remove blacklist reasons.
